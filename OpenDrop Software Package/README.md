0. Operating system:
--------------------
In the spirit of its open source and free nature, OpenDrop is recommended for use with Linux, and has been extenstively tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

OpenDrop also works on most versions of Mac OSX and on Windows (7,8 and 10), provided that Python and OpenCV libraries are successfully installed, however this has not been extensively tested.

1. Installation:
----------------
OpenDrop itself does not require installation. Simply place the files and modules folder in a suitable location on your computer. 

OpenDrop has dependencies on the following resources/libraries:
- Python
- OpenCV

If not contained within the Python/OpenCV installation method that you choose, also required are:
- Python-scipy
- Python-matplotlib
- Python-numpy

Make sure these are installed for your operating system before running OpenDrop. See Appendix A for how to prepare a fresh installation of Ubuntu 14.04 for OpenDrop, Appendix B for installation on Windows 7, 8 and 10, and Appendix C for installation on Mac OSX. 

2. Image source selection:
--------------------------
OpenDrop can currently utilise images from three sources:
  * Point Grey cameras (Linux/Windows - the script supplied is for Linux, but a Windows script of the same name could also be used). An installation guide for getting these set up under Ubuntu is provided in Appendix D. OpenDrop has been tested with Flea3 and Grasshopper 3 USB cameras.
  * Any generic USB camera that is regonised by the operating system as a standard functioning camera (currently Linux/Mac, appears to also work on Windows 7). Selecting this option will utilise the primary camera, i.e. the one listed as "camera0".
  * Local images (all operating systems). This option allows a user to select a locally stored image file for fitting. Use this option if your camera is not supported by one of the protocols above.

3. Running measurements:
------------------------
For Ubuntu, the OpenDrop.py file can be made "double-clickable" by changing the default Nautilus preferences (Edit --> Preferences --> Behaviour). Similarly, so can the more universal "run" file. If your operating system is setup for this behaviour, simply double-click "run" to start the software.

Alternatively, running:
>  ./run 

in a terminal will provide a verbose terminal and run the program.

A window will appear requiring input for system parameters such as image source, needle diameter, droplet and continuous phase density, etc. The selection items should be fairly obvious. Boxes will be recalled from previous values after the first use.

Once the settings have been suitably adjusted, select "Run". This should capture/open an image from the selected source, and bring up an OpenCV window containing this window. As requested, draw boxes over the desired fitting area of the drop, and a section of the needle that is representative and clear from contamination/aberrations. After each selection, press either the "enter" or "space" key. 

The automated fitting routine will then commence. A file is created with the specified name and a date-time stamp containing the fitted data.

4. Sessile drops:
------------------------
The current distribution cannot process sessile drops. However, we do have a beta version that can, and it will be included in the next release. In the interim, if you would like to process sessile drops please [email](mailto:opendrop.dev@gmail.com) us and we will provide you with the code and instructions.

Preparing Ubuntu 14.04 for OpenDrop.
------------------------------------

The following commands typed into the terminal will prepare an installation of Ubuntu 14.04.01 for OpenDrop, installing all required libraries and fixing dependencies. An unresolvable conflict (that may have since been corrected) was encountered when trying this process with 14.04.02.

> sudo apt-get update

> sudo apt-get upgrade

> sudo apt-get install build-essential libgtk2.0-dev libjpeg-dev libtiff4-dev libjasper-dev libopenexr-dev cmake python-dev python-numpy python-tk libtbb-dev libeigen3-dev yasm libfaac-dev libopencore-amrnb-dev libopencore-amrwb-dev libtheora-dev libvorbis-dev libxvidcore-dev libx264-dev libqt4-dev libqt4-opengl-dev sphinx-common texlive-latex-extra libv4l-dev libdc1394-22-dev libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libswscale-dev default-jdk ant libvtk5-qt4-dev

> make

> sudo make install

> sudo gedit /etc/ld.so.conf.d/opencv.conf

and add line

> sudo ldconfig

> sudo gedit /etc/bash.bashrc

and add lines
PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$PKG_CONFIG_PATH:/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH
close the console and open a new one, restart the computer or logout and then login again.

Appendix B
==========

Preparing Windows 7 for OpenDrop.
------------------------------------
* Download the free Anaconda Python distribution from [here](http://continuum.io/downloads), and install (tested and works with Anaconda 64-bit Python 2.7 Graphical Installer). 
* Download the latest OpenCV release from [here](http://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/files/opencv-win/) and double-click to extract it (tested and works with opencv-3.0.0-rc1.exe). The folder opencv will be created in the folder you extract to. 
* Go to the opencv/build/python/2.7/x64 folder (x86 for 32-bit), and then copy cv2.pyd to the C:/Python27/lib/site-packages/ folder. If this doesn't work, or if this folder doesn't exist, copy cv2.pyd to the C:/Anaconda/Lib/site-packages/ folder.
* Now open the OpenDrop folder, and double-click on "run.bat". If everything has installed correctly, OpenDrop should start.

If you have any problems, find alternative solutions, or manage to install successfully on other Windows versions please let us know.

Preparing Windows 8 (& 10) for OpenDrop.
------------------------------------
* Download the free Anaconda Python distribution from [here](http://continuum.io/downloads), and install (tested and works with Anaconda 64-bit Python 2.7 Graphical Installer). 
* Download the latest OpenCV release from [here](http://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/files/opencv-win/) and double-click to extract it (tested and works with opencv-3.0.0.exe). The folder opencv will be created in the folder you extract to. 
* Go to the opencv/build/python/2.7/x64 folder (x86 for 32-bit), and then copy cv2.pyd to the C:/Python27/lib/site-packages/ folder. If this doesn't work, or if this folder doesn't exist, copy cv2.pyd to the C:/Anaconda2/Lib/site-packages/ folder.
* Now open the OpenDrop folder, and double-click on "run.bat". If everything has installed correctly, OpenDrop should start.

Preparing Windows 10 for OpenDrop.
------------------------------------
* Download the free Anaconda Python distribution from [here](http://continuum.io/downloads), and install (tested and works with Anaconda 64-bit Python 2.7 Graphical Installer). 
* Download the latest OpenCV release from [here](http://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/files/opencv-win/) and double-click to extract it (tested and works with opencv-3.0.0.exe). The folder opencv will be created in the folder you extract to. 
* Go to the opencv/build/python/2.7/x64 folder (x86 for 32-bit), and then copy cv2.pyd to the C:/Python27/lib/site-packages/ folder. If this doesn't work, or if this folder doesn't exist, copy cv2.pyd to the C:/Anaconda2/Lib/site-packages/ folder. If this doesn't exist, see the point below. 
* ONLY if you have installed Anaconda/Python for one user only (not for all users) then your "site-packages" folder will be located somewhere within that user directory. You can find it with a simple search, and then copy cv2.pyd into it.
* Now open the OpenDrop folder, and double-click on "run.bat". If everything has installed correctly, OpenDrop should start.

If you have any problems, find alternative solutions, or manage to install successfully on other Windows versions please let us know.
